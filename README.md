## The Algorithm

I developed an AI system that runs on the NVIDIA Jetson Nano to analyze blood smear images and detect signs of leukemia. The system processes images through normalization, cell segmentation, and classification using a deep learning model. Trained on datasets, the model differentiates between normal and leukemia cells by examining features such as size, shape, and staining patterns. Using the Jetson Nanoâ€™s computing power, the system provides real-time processing and classification, offering prompt and reliable results for medical diagnostics.
